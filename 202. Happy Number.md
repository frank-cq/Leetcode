## 202. Happy Number

>Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

>A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

>Example: 19 is a happy number

>$$1^2 + 9^2 = 82$$
>$$8^2 + 2^2 = 68$$
>$$6^2 + 8^2 = 100$$
>$$1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1$$

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        Set<Integer> transition = new HashSet<>();
        int squareSum = 0;
        while (!transition.contains(n)) {
            squareSum = getSquareSum(n);
            if (squareSum == 1) {
                return true;
            } else {
                transition.add(n);
                n = squareSum;
            }

        }

        return false;
    }
    public int getSquareSum(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        int singleNum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            singleNum = n%10;
            n /= 10;
            sum += singleNum*singleNum;
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
